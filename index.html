                                <p class="paragraph">A lot of your customers use Youtube as their primary search engine. On YouTube and other video hosting sites you can find the answers to pretty much anything on this planet. Any product, if it is to be successful in the
                                    marketplace has to be solving a problem. And not just any problem, but a relevant problem. And increasingly, as google searches turn up mostly ads and zero calorie sites (sites with very little actual usable content)
                                    , increasingly users are turning to YouTube. YouTube is a modern day Oracle of Delphi, a magical crystal ball where you can see anything and everything, and get any and all questions coherently answered. You can ask
                                    the most outlandish questions and odds are someone has answered that on YouTube with a video that addresses your question.
                                </p>
                                <p class="paragraph">
                                    What problems does your product or service solve? Does it answer one of those 'How to..?' or 'How do I....' questions on Youtube? Or even better, does it answer a lot of those questions? If it does, your product is a winner waiting for the big moment.

                                    Let me explain exactly how VideoFromText fits in wtih your business strategy. You can realistically generate hundreds of videos for your product in a matter of minutes, all with background music, TEXT overlays, and Voice Overs. All you have to do is create
                                    a free account on pixabay.com (pixabay is a image hosting website that provides 'commercial use permitted' royalty free images generously), you can get a free pixabay API code from pixaybay.com and enter it into the
                                    settings of VideoFromText. Then all you have to do is write your script, you can enter it into a text file in this format:

                                    yourself. Democracy is only as strong as the schools. </br>
                                    # </br>It took a million years for the earth to become what it is today. Green and blue and beautiful. It takes only a few moments of madness to take everything away. Educate your leaders about peace and war. Ensure

                                    can add intro and extros with your logo or whatever else you want, to be attached to the beginning and end of each video (must be 5MB or less). Each video is also automatically named using the last line in the script
                                    as the file name.

                                    The power of this sytem is that with zero video editing skills and zero time spent messing with videos, you can create hundreds of videos that have music , text and voice , and you can use this for your marketing, you can use these on facebook, youtube
                                    , instagram, and wherever else you want your videos to be. This is a way better alternative to using one of those subscription sites, that charge upward of $ 400 per year. With VideoFromText you can use it entirely
                                    free and without any pesky watermarks for 14 days, and during that time you can make as many videos as you make. At the end of that you can optionally buy a lifetime license for a one time payment of a mere $49, and
                                    use it as much as you like and make thousands of videos if you like and absolutely dominate your niche.
